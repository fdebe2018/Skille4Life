  <h2 class="w3-center"> How to Write a Resume </h2>
    <p> The first thing you need to do when you are creating a resume, is think about the type of resume you will be making.
      There are four main types; chronological, functional, combination, or targeted.
        <ul>
          <li>Chronological Resume: One of the most common resume types. It starts by listing your work history, and the most
            recent position listed first. Employers would most likely prefer this kind of resume because it is easy to see what jobs you
            previously held. Your education, certifications, and special skills are also included in this type of
            resume and it comes after your liksted work experiance.</li>
          <li> Functional Resume: This type of resume focuses on skills and experiance, rather than on your work history. It is best to use this resume
              if there are gaps in your employment history, or your work history is not directly related to the job your seeking. This resume allows
              for the employer to focus on the skills you have and not what jobs you have obtained in the past.</li>
          <li> Combination Resume:This type of resume is used to show the employer your most relevant skills, while still documenting your work history.
               It is also a good way of answering the reader's questions about career changes, gaps in your history, and other potential red flags. </li>
          <li> Targeted Resume: Focuses on a specific job opening. It is written to highlight your skills and experainces that is relevant to the position you
              are applying for. When sending a targeted resume, it has to be edited for each job that you apply to. </li>
        </ul>
